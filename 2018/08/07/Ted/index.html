encounter the world self. Substitute the Word in others. Instead of self-help,
other help.Instead of, Self-esteem other-esteem.

that I enjoy the life present more than before. I  began to make progress with my research.
My goal is simple. It is complete of understanding of the universe.

Those who live in the shadow of death are also live most.</strong>

      <p>That the people who fared the best were the people who leaned into relationships.
with family, with friends, with the community.It might be something as simple as replacing
screen time with people time.or livening up a stale relationship by doing something
new together, long walk or date nights.or reaching out to that family member
who you haven't spoken to in years.I would like to close with a quote from Mark Twain's.
More than a century ago,he was looking back on his life, and he wrote this:
<strong>"There isn't time, so brief is life for bickerings, apologies, heartburnings,
callings to account, There is only time for loving, and but an instant, so to speak,
for that</strong>."The good life is built with good relationships.</p>
